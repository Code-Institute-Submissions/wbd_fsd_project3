<div style="about_text"> 
    <p>This site started out as a class project for a full stack development course I was taking.  I often use a "quotation database" to learn software
     development on a new system.
    I've done so for years on everything from a DEC OpenVMS VAX minicomputer as a DCL command line tool, to Visual Basic 6 and VB.NET/Visual Studio 
    desktop app for Windows, to a Java desktop application (jar) for Windows and MacOS, to a web application written using Java Server Pages and the Eclipse IDE.</p>

    <p>So it was natural to do that for a project in this course when we started working with databaes. This particular incarnation was written using the GitPod IDE tied to GitHub, and written in Python3 using the Flask and Materialize frameworks, and using MongoDB (and PyMongo) for the web application and database. Plus a bit o' JavaScript and jQuery. 
    It's hosted on Heroku at present.</p>
