## Reasoning for the project

For several decades now I have used a "quotations" database to learn how to program on a variety of systems, from OpenVMS DCL command line on VAX and Alpha minicomputers, to Visual Basic 6 and VB.Net/Visual Studio IDEs to create desktop apps on Windows, to Java desktop apps (jar) on Windows and Mac (including a stand-alone desktop app on the Mac) and then on to JavaServer Pages using Eclipse.  This allows me to learn how to use the basic CRUD concepts on a particular platform.  Over the years I have collected thousands of quotes to use as well.  

So of course, I wanted to do the same thing when taking this course on modern full-stack web development from Code Institute. 

I realized quickly that the Task Manager miniproject that is developed as you go through the Data Centric Development module of the FSD course would be a perfect fit for my Quotations project, so I actually started developing it in parallel as the course went through the mini-project, though I also started adapting and modifying it for my needs.  For example, I added a search feature and some sorting of the databases (quotations sorted by person's name, categories sorted by category name) as well as data itemus such as "favorite" (instead of urgent), source of the quote, star rating (1-5), date said, a link to a photo from Wikimedia Commons, etc. 

I wanted both a "favorites" and a "star rating" system for quotes, and the ability to share quotes via email (possibly other means such as texting, copy-and-paste, etc later) and to "meme" the quote onto an image background. I was not able to implement all of those features as time allows, but I will in the future as a platform to practice and expand what I am learning. I may actually make the site look more like Google at some point - start out with just a search field. That's what I did when I developed a web app using Java Server Pages, for example. I have registered the domain name "quooqle" (Q's not G's) but am not sure if I want to use it. Google has more money for lawyers than I do!  So I also reqistered quotation.space and quotations.space long before I started this project (the later is the plural of the former.).  I plan to hook those up to this site eventually. 

I'll be continuing to develop this project after I have finished the Code Institute Course for personal use and perhaps as a side business.

# DEPLOYMENT

*REQUIREMENTS*
- Python 3
- Git 
- A GitHub free account
- A Heroku free account (or some other hosting environment, if you want, 
- MongoDB
- Python Frameworks
    - Flask
    - PyMongo (flask-pymongo)
    - dnspython
- Materialize CSS Framework 

As of this writing, the requirements.txt file lists the following frameworks:

- click==7.1.2
- dnspython==1.16.0
- Flask==1.1.2
- Flask-PyMongo==2.3.0
- itsdangerous==1.1.0
- pymongo==3.10.1
- Werkzeug==1.0.1

NOTE: These are not necesssarily the latest versions of these frameworks. 

## SETUP PROCESS

- Create a free MongoDB Atlas account and set up a database

    https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/signup

    Set a database and the following collections:

    DATABASE STRUCTURE

        Database: quotations_space
        
            Collections:

                quotations
                    _id (autogenerated)
                    category_name               String
                    quotation_text              String
                    person                      String
                    source                      String 
                    date_said                   String
                    stars_rating                String
                    is_favorite                 String
                    wikicommons_photo           String
                    wikicommons_attribution     String
                    wikipedia_bio               String

                categories
                    category_name               String

                In future I will create a "persons" collection and move the 
                    wiki& fields to that, and look up information from it
                    using the "person" name, as we do for categories. 

Add a few quotes in manually to thease collectons and give the quotes a category from the categories collection. 

- Set up a GitPod account. If you want to use some other environment, feel free, of course, but these instructions assume GitPod and GitHub and Heroku.

Note:This project started from a clone of the Code Institute student template for Gitpod which preinstalls most of the tools needed for basic development. 

- Set up a Heroku account.  If you want to use some other web app hosting environment or host it locally you may, but these instructions assume hosting on Heroku. 


- Clone or copy the Quotations.Space! project into your project. 

    - https://github.com/billdavisjr/quotations-space 

    << clone this to a FSB_Milestone_Project_3 repo and replace this URL 
    BEFORE submitting this project. >>

- install the following frameworks:
    $ pip3 install flask
    $ pip3 install flask-pymongo
    $ pip3 install dnspython

- Create the Heroku Requirements pip3 freeze > requirements.txt file if needed at the root directory of the project:

    - $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

- Create the Heroku Procfile if needed at the root directory of the project

    - $ echo web: python app.py >Procfile

- Heroku setup (if you're using it)

$ heroku ps:scale web=1

- Set up the environment variables in GitPod
    https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables/

    IP = 0.0.0.0
    PORT = 5001
    QS_MONGO_URI=  (the address for your Mongo database screated earlier
    
    << add how to get the path to the Mongo database >>

- Set up environment variables in Heroku (or your own environment if not)
    - IP=0.0.0.0. (may be provided by web/app server)
    - PORT=5001   (may be provided by web/app server)
    - QS_MONGO_URI   


These IP addresess are set up in the Heroku web app for a particular app under Settings in the "Config Vars" section.


## Starting up the Project 

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.


## TEST PLAN

### Testing environments

- Mac OS X (MacBook Pro and iMac)
- iPhone smartphone ()
- iPad tablet

NOTE: I do not have access to Android or Windows or Linux equipment to test on at this time.  I cannot test on Windows at work because Heroku is blocked and we are not allowed
to install software on our machines.


TESTS

Problems should be logged in in the Issues tab on the GitHub repo.

- Test that the site and all pages looks and functions well on all platforms.
    - On desktop PC, test using different window widths and heights
    - On smartphones and tablets, test in both portrait and landscape orientation.

- Add new quotes, test all the fields
    - Add stars wwith values from 0 to 5 as well as fractions such 
    as 0.5, 1.5 ... 4.5, 5.0
    -
